# Blockchain-Based E-Voting System

## Introduction
This project is a Blockchain-based e-voting system designed to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. The system leverages the immutable nature of blockchain technology to provide a decentralized platform for voting, ensuring that every vote is recorded accurately and cannot be altered or deleted.

## Features
- **Security**: Each vote is encrypted and stored in a blockchain, making it nearly impossible to tamper with the results.
- **Transparency**: The voting process is transparent and auditable by anyone, ensuring the integrity of the election.
- **Decentralization**: The system is decentralized, removing the need for a central authority and reducing the risk of fraud.
- **Anonymity**: Voters' identities are kept anonymous, protecting their privacy while ensuring that each person can vote only once.
- **Accessibility**: The platform is accessible online, allowing voters to cast their votes from anywhere.

## Components
1. **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity, these manage the voting process, including voter registration, vote casting, and vote counting.
2. **Frontend**: Built with React, this provides the user interface for voters to interact with the system.
3. **Backend**: Uses Node.js and Express to handle API requests and interact with the blockchain.
4. **Blockchain**: Implemented on the Ethereum network using Truffle for development and Ganache for testing.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- Truffle
- Ganache
- MetaMask (browser extension for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
